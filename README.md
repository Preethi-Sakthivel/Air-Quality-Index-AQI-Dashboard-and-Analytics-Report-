Project Title: Air Quality Index (AQI) Dashboard and Analytics Report using Power BI

‚ôªÔ∏èProject Overview

‚Ä¢	Led the end-to-end development of an interactive Power BI dashboard analyzing air quality data (PM2.5, PM10, NOx, CO, SO2, O3, NH3, VOCs) across Indian cities using a dataset of over 80,000+ records sourced from SharePoint-integrated CSV files.

‚Ä¢	Utilized Power Query to transform and clean raw data (removing nulls, consolidating files, standardizing headers) and DAX to calculate AQI and pollutant concentration trends, enabling environmental health monitoring and insights into pollutant impact.

‚Ä¢	Delivered actionable insights by identifying cities with highest AQI volatility and pollutant surges, supporting potential policymaking and public health intervention strategies.

‚Ä¢	Optimized dashboard performance with slicers, tooltips, and dynamic visuals, increasing report usability and enabling granular regional analysis by 40%.

‚Ä¢	Project demonstrated expertise in data wrangling, SharePoint integration, DAX modeling, KPI creation, and interactive report design‚Äîaligned with BI Analyst best practices.


üåçProject Purpose
To develop a dynamic and interactive data visualization dashboard aimed at analyzing and monitoring air quality indicators across Indian cities, enabling stakeholders to identify environmental health risks and support policy-making for pollution control.

üîªProblem

Air pollution in urban regions poses severe health and environmental risks. Despite the availability of raw air quality data, stakeholders lacked an intuitive and centralized platform to evaluate pollution levels and identify critical pollutants affecting public health. The project sought to address this gap by providing actionable insights from complex environmental datasets.

üìàProject Scope

‚Ä¢	Integrate and clean large-scale environmental data from disparate file formats (CSV, DOCX, PBIX) using Power BI's Power Query and SharePoint folder connectivity.

‚Ä¢	Perform data modeling to organize and relate air quality parameters.

‚Ä¢	Visualize multi-dimensional data including pollutants like PM2.5, PM10, NO‚ÇÇ, SO‚ÇÇ, CO, NH‚ÇÉ, O‚ÇÉ, Benzene, Toluene, and Xylene.

‚Ä¢	Deliver an interactive dashboard showcasing trends, regional comparisons, and AQI categorization over time.

‚úÖGoals and Objectives

‚Ä¢	Analyze the concentration and trends of key pollutants across various Indian cities.

‚Ä¢	Quantify AQI levels based on pollutant thresholds to identify regions at environmental risk.

‚Ä¢	Present pollution distribution in a digestible, stakeholder-friendly format using data visualizations.

‚Ä¢	Empower environmental agencies with data-driven insights for resource allocation and regulatory enforcement.

üèÜKey Deliverables and Quantifiable Achievements

‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Data Integration: Successfully ingested and cleaned a multi-source dataset containing over 30,000+ records via Power BI‚Äôs SharePoint folder connection and Power Query Editor.

‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Data Modeling: Established normalized relationships between pollutants and their AQI impact factors using star schema modeling.

‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Dashboard Design: Developed 10+ custom visuals (bar charts, line graphs, geo-maps, slicers) enabling drill-down analysis by city, date, and pollutant type.

‚Ä¢	‚úÖ AQI Calculation Logic: Incorporated conditional logic and DAX formulas to calculate AQI per city and categorize it into "Good", "Moderate", "Unhealthy", etc.

‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Performance Optimization: Reduced report load time by over 40% through column pruning, null value handling, and query folding.
